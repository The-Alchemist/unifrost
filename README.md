⚠ This project is on early stage, it's not ready for production yet ⚠

goChan is a go module for relaying pubsub messages to the web via
[SSE(Eventsource)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events).
It is based on Twitter's implementation for real-time event-streaming
in their new web app.

It uses the [Go CDK](https://gocloud.dev) as vendor neutral pubsub driver
that supports multiple pubusub vendors:

- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- Amazon Simple Queueing Service (Pending)
- Azure Service Bus (Pending)
- RabbitMQ
- NATS
- Kafka
- In-Memory (Only for testing)

## Installation

goChan supports Go modules and built against go version 1.13

```shell
go get github.com/rajveermalviya/gochan
```

## Documentation

For documentation check [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rajveermalviya/gochan).

## Usage

goChan uses Server-Sent-Events, because of this it doesn't require to run a
standalone server, unlike websockets it can be embedded in your api server.
goChan's streamer has a ServeHTTP method i.e it implements http.Handler
interface so that it can be used directly or can be wrapped with middlewares
like Authentication easily.

```go
// Using streamer directly
streamer, err := gochan.NewStreamer(ctx, &gochan.ConfigStreamer{
	Driver:       drivers.DriverMem,
	DriverConfig: &drivers.ConfigMem{},
})

log.Fatal("HTTP server error: ", http.ListenAndServe("localhost:3000", streamer))
```

```go
// Using streamer by wrapping it in auth middleware
streamer, err := gochan.NewStreamer(ctx, &gochan.ConfigStreamer{
	Driver:       drivers.DriverMem,
	DriverConfig: &drivers.ConfigMem{},
})

mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("/events", func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    err := Auth(w,r)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    streamer.ServeHTTP(w,r)
})
log.Fatal("HTTP server error: ", http.ListenAndServe("localhost:3000", mux))
```

When client connects to the server it will send two system messages upfront,

1. Configuration: it contains the client-id and client-ttl set by the
   streamer config
2. Subscriptions associated with the specified client id. These messages have
   topic prefixed with '/system'.

New client is created explicitly using the `streamer.NewClient()` for
client with auto generated id or `streamer.NewCustomClient()` for client
with specified id.

This makes it easy to integrate authentication to the streamer, just create
a new client when user connects to your application and return the gochan
streamer `client_id` (custom or autogenerated) with your API auth workflow.
If you don't care about authentication, you can also generate a new client
automatically everytime a new client connects without the `id` parameter
use the following middleware with the streamer.

```go
mux.HandleFunc("/events", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Auto generate new clientID, when new client connects.
    q := r.URL.Query()
    if q.Get("id") == "" {
        client, _ := streamer.NewClient(ctx)
        q.Set("id", client.ID)
        r.URL.RawQuery = q.Encode()
    }

    streamer.ServeHTTP(w, r)
})
```

When a client gets disconnected it has a time window to connect to the server
again with the state unchanged. If client ttl is not specified in the
streamer config then default ttl is set to one.

## Why Server Sent Events (SSE) ?

Why would you choose SSE over WebSockets?

One reason SSEs have been kept in the shadow is because later APIs like
WebSockets provide a richer protocol to perform bi-directional, full-duplex
communication. However, in some scenarios data doesn't need to be sent from the
client. You simply need updates from some server action. A few examples would
be friends' status updates, stock tickers, news feeds, or other automated data
push mechanisms (e.g. updating a client-side Web SQL Database or IndexedDB
object store). If you'll need to send data to a server, Fetch API is always a
friend.

SSEs are sent over traditional HTTP. That means they do not require a special
protocol or server implementation to get working. WebSockets on the other hand,
require full-duplex connections and new Web Socket servers to handle the
protocol. In addition, Server-Sent Events have a variety of features that
WebSockets lack by design such as automatic reconnection, event IDs, and the
ability to send arbitrary events.

Because SSE works on top of HTTP, it always stays updated. For example HTTP/3
will use QUIC protocol as transport layer that improves data streaming and many
more improvements.

## Future Goals:

- Standalone server that can be configured by yaml, while also staying modular.
- Making it horizontally scalabe using Redis as state backend.
- Creating a website for documentation & overview, and some examples.
- Become a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) project (...maybe).
